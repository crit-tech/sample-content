###### Actions

**_Bite_**. _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. _Hit:_ 7 (1d8+3) piercing damage, and the target must make a DC 11 Constitution saving throw, taking 9 (2d8) poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. If the poison damage reduces the target to 0 hit points, the target is stable but poisoned for 1 hour, even after regaining hit points, and is paralyzed while poisoned in this way.

**_Web (Recharge 5-6)_**. _Ranged Weapon Attack:_ +5 to hit, range 30/60 ft., one creature. _Hit:_ The target is restrained by webbing. As an action, the restrained target can make a DC 12 Strength check, bursting the webbing on a success. The webbing can also be attacked and destroyed (AC 10; hp 5; vulnerability to fire damage; immunity to bludgeoning, poison, and psychic damage).

To snare its prey, a **giant spider** spins elaborate webs or shoots sticky strands of webbing from its abdomen. Giant spiders are most commonly found underground, making their lairs on ceilings or in dark, web-filled crevices. Such lairs are often festooned with web cocoons holding past victims.
