If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 12 Constitution saving throw against disease or become poisoned until the disease is cured.

The creature dies if the disease reduces its hit point maximum to 0.

A **death dog** is an ugly two-headed hound that roams plains, and deserts. Hate burns in a death dog's heart, and a taste for humanoid flesh drives it to attack travelers and explorers. Death dog saliva carries a foul disease that causes a victim's flesh to slowly rot off the bone.
